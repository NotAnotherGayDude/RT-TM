# NIHILUS

**Nihilus** is a lock-free, compile-time materialized, high-performance CPU execution engine for static compute graphs — built entirely in modern C++23.

Designed for extreme throughput and deterministic behavior, Nihilus executes models like LLaMA 8B using **no dynamic scheduling**, **no mutexes**, and **no runtime graph traversal**.  
The entire graph is compiled into types. Execution is a **direct memory walk**. Synchronization is used **only where required** — around blocking operations like matrix multiplies — via ultra-light, per-layer latch primitives.

> _“Nothing blocks. Nothing schedules. Only execution.”_

## 🚨 Benchmark: LLaMA 8B Inference

| Model     | Threads | llama.cpp Time | **Nihilus Time** | Speedup |
|-----------|---------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| LLaMA 8B  | 32      | ~4.5 ms        | **~3.4 µs**      | **~1335x** |

## 💡 What Is Nihilus?

Nihilus is:

- A **statically typed compute graph** where every op is a compile-time `core_traits<>` struct
- A **template-expanded execution engine**, not a runtime scheduler
- A **lock-free**, **queue-free**, **graphless executor** that synchronizes *only* where math requires it
- A **memory-aligned, stride-based architecture** that eliminates the need for reshape/permute ops
- An **architecture-specialized dispatch system**, selecting AVX2/AVX-512/NEON/SVE at runtime and inlining kernels statically

## 🧠 Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Compile-Time Graph Layout** | Ops are statically materialized via `core_traits<>` and aggregated into a monolithic model base. |
| **Latch-Synchronized Blocking Ops** | Matrix multiplies and similar ops are synchronized per-block using `latch_wrapper_holder`. All other ops are fully async across threads. |
| **Zero Dynamic Scheduling** | No mutexes, queues, semaphores, or per-op dependencies. Thread coordination is resolved entirely at compile time. |
| **Strided Linear Memory Walk** | Inputs and outputs are formatted to allow single-pointer, linearly incremented access — eliminating `reshape()`, `permute()`, `contiguous()` transforms. |
| **Output Transforms** | Compile-time `output_transform<From, To>` structs reformat outputs in-place for consumption by downstream ops. |
| **Architecture-Aware Kernel Dispatch** | A `kernel_dispatcher` resolves the correct CPU-specialized kernel path at compile time using the detected architecture. |
| **Unified Aligned Allocator** | A model-wide arena allocator pre-allocates all memory up front, aligned to CPU requirements. No `malloc()` during execution. |
| **Thread Affinity & Priority** | Optional core pinning and thread priority escalation for consistent real-time behavior. |

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Each op is defined via a `core_traits<config, op>` template
- The model aggregates these into a `core_bases<>` inheritance chain
- A `thread_pool<>` invokes execution over:
  - `global_input` ops
  - `per_block` ops (with sync only where necessary)
  - `global_output` ops
- For blocking ops, `sync_flag_start[].arrive_and_wait()` and `sync_flag_end[].arrive_and_wait()` create minimal synchronization points
- Non-blocking ops are run **lock-free** and **unordered** across threads
- Memory layout ensures stride-aligned single-pointer reads/writes
- Kernels are selected via architecture-indexed `kernel_dispatcher_impl<>` with full type specialization

## 🧘 Execution Philosophy

> Nihilus doesn’t interpret.
> Nihilus doesn’t schedule.
> Nihilus **executes**.

Each thread steps through its part of the graph like reading a prophecy.
Each op lives in memory like carved stone.
Each kernel hits the hardware like a compiled spell.

> There are no locks.
> Only **latches** — and only where math demands it.
> **Everything else?**
> Pure flow.
